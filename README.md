# SAP Automation
This repo contains two different projects. The first one will help you install install SAP HANA on a single VM running SUSE SLES 12 SP 2. The second one deals with more complex scenarios, different components and high availability.

 Both use the Azure SKUs for SAP. The templates take advantage of [Custom Script Extensions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions/tree/master/CustomScript) for the installation and configuration of the machines. Both should be used only for demonstration and sandbox environments. This is not a production deployment.
