# SAP HANA in High availability
## Machine Info
The template currently deploys two virtual machines with HANA installed, configures HANA System Replication (HSR) and creates an OS level cluster based on the Linux High Availability Extension for SUSE. The virtual machines are deployed with the configuration listed in the table below with the noted disk configuration.  The deployment takes advantage of Managed Disks, for more information on Managed Disks or the sizes of the noted disks can be found on [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview#pricing-and-billing) page.
#### Cost conscious Azure Storage configuration
The following table shows a configuration of VM types that customers commonly use to host SAP HANA on Azure VMs. There might be some VM types that might not meet all minimum criteria for SAP HANA. But so far those VMs seemed to perform fine for non-production scenarios. 

> [!NOTE]
> For production scenarios, check whether a certain VM type is supported for SAP HANA by SAP in the [SAP documentation for IAAS](https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html).

## Prerequisites
To create an sbd device for the cluster configuration, the Custom Script Extension leverages an existing ISCSI server. The deployment assumes that an ISCSI target is already set up. For more information on setting up the ISCSI server please refer to the [ISCSI documentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Hana-Test-Deploy/master/sap-iscsi-server/README.md).

## Installation Media
Installation media for SAP HANA should be downloaded and placed in the SapBits folder. You will need to provide the URI for the container where they are stored, for example https://yourBlobName.blob.core.windows.net/yourContainerName. For more information on how to upload files to Azure please go [here](UploadToAzure.md)  Specifically you need to download SAP package 51052325, which should consist of four files:
```
51052325_part1.exe
51052325_part2.rar
51052325_part3.rar
51052325_part4.rar
```

If you want to use a newer version of HANA Studio rename your filename to IMC_STUDIO2_212_2-80000323.SAR.

The Server Java Runtime Environment bits can be downloaded [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/server-jre9-downloads-3848530.html).

There should be a folder inside your storage account container called SapBits:

The following files should be present inside the SapBits folder:

## Deploy the Solution
### Deploy from the Portal

To deploy  the infrastructre from the portal using a graphic interface you can use the [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzureCAT-GSI%2FSAP-HANA-S4%2Fmaster%2Fsap-hana-cluster%2Fazuredeploy-hsr-infra.json)

To deploy the Custom Script Extension to install and configure the software,  from the portal using a graphic interface you can use [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzureCAT-GSI%2FSAP-HANA-S4%2Fmaster%2Fsap-hana-cluster%2Fazuredeploy-hsr-sw.json)

## Monitoring

For your deployment to be supported by SAP the Azure Enhanced Monitoring Extension must be enabled on the Virtual Machine. Please refer to the following [blog post](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/deployment-guide#d98edcd3-f2a1-49f7-b26a-07448ceb60ca) for more information on how to enable it.

## Known issues
### When clicking on Deploy to Azure you get redirected to an empty directory
![Directories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Hana-Test-Deploy/master/media/directories.png)

The only way to get around this is to save the template to your own template library. Click on "Create a Resource" and choose "Template Deployment". Click "Create".

![Directories2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Hana-Test-Deploy/master/media/directories2.png)

Select the option of "Build your own template in the editor"

![Directories3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Hana-Test-Deploy/master/media/directories3.png)

Copy the contents from the azuredeploy.json [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Hana-Test-Deploy/master/azuredeploy.json) and paste them into the template editor, click Save.

![Directories4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureCAT-GSI/Hana-Test-Deploy/master/media/directories4.png)

The template is now available in your template library. Changes made to the github repo will not be replicated, make sure to update your template when changes to the azuredeploy.json file are made.
